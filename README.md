## [Project 1: Visualizing The Housing Market in Melbourne, Australia](https://github.com/rodrigorosalesa/Data-601)
In this project, I worked with two fellow Masters of Data Science (MDSA) students at the University of Calgary to analyze and visualize housing market data from Melbourne, Australia using Python (focus on NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries). We used the [Housing Market Snapshot](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot) dataset, which we found on [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/), to complete this project and satisfy our course requirements.
