# Portfolio
Paul Croome's portfolio of Data Science projects. 


## [Project 1: Visualizing The Housing Market in Melbourne, Australia](https://github.com/rodrigorosalesa/Data-601)
In this project, I worked with two fellow Masters of Data Science (MDSA) students at the University of Calgary to analyze and visualize housing market data from Melbourne, Australia using Python (focus on NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries). We used the [Housing Market Snapshot](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot) dataset, which we found on [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/), to complete this project and satisfy our course requirements. 

This project included the following steps: 
- Asking appropriate questions regarding the dataset
- Data cleaning and data wrangling
- Data exploration
- Visualizing data via line plots, bar graphs, histograms, box plots, and even an interactive map
- Using visualization techniques and statistical analyses to answer questions about the dataset

## [Project 2: COVID-19, Public Safety Measures, and Public and Fiscal Health in G20 Countries](https://github.com/rodrigorosalesa/Portfolio/tree/main/Covid_19_Analysis)
Working with four other Masters of Data Science (MDSA) students at the University of Calgary, this project was aimed toward answering the following questions: 
  1. How did COVID-19 impact the performance of the financial markets in G20 countries?
  2. Did government and societal healthcare actions influence the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 in G20 countries?
  3. Which factors of a country's population are most related to the severity and prevalence of COVID-19?

To answer these questions, we used SQL and Python (focus on NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, and Plotly libraries) to analyze the COVID-19 dataset from [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data), which we found on Our World in Data's [COVID-19 Data Explorer](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&time=2020-03-01..latest&facet=none&pickerSort=asc&pickerMetric=location&Metric=Confirmed+cases&Interval=7-day+rolling+average&Relative+to+Population=true&Color+by+test+positivity=false&country=USA~GBR~CAN~DEU~ITA~IND). 

This project included the following steps: 
- Defining our guiding questions
- Locating our dataset and loading it to a shared database
- Appropriately joining and wrangling tables
- Cleaning the data and feature engineering
- Appropriately exploring and visualizing data toward answering our aforementioned questions
- Using visualizations, statistical analyses, and critical reasoning to draw appropriate conclusions regarding our dataset
